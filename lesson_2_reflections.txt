What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when i initilaized a repository it created a .git metadata directory and now it is ready to perform commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	We add the files to the staging area which has to be modified. While working directory has untracked files.
